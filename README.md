Basically, it is suposed to simulate generations of life cells, based in the following rules for each generation.


1 - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.

2 - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3 - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.

4 - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
